description: 'Her mouth was almost pressed against his, and her words were like quick,
  hurried kisses: "You must absolutely go through with the duel tomorrow." An absorbing
  saga about the brutalities of military life upon its own soldiers. Stranded at a
  distant outpost, young Romashov finds himself obliged to fight a duel--over something
  he realizes is meaningless. As the novel hurtles toward a startling conclusion,
  it reveals itself to be a luminous depiction of the end of an era.'
